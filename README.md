# Blocks Of Hanoi

## Description

Blocks of Hanoi is a WebGL-based interactive visualization of the classic Towers of Hanoi puzzle. This project demonstrates graphical transformations, texture mapping, and interactive 3D graphics programming using WebGL and JavaScript.

## Features

- Interactive Controls: Rotate the puzzle using mouse drag movements and zoom in/out using the mouse scroll wheel.

- Manual and Automated Solutions: Manually navigate through solution steps or automatically visualize the solution.

- Real-Time Lighting and Textures: Dynamic lighting and detailed textures to enhance visual realism.

- Smooth Animations: Smooth rotation and transitions between solution states.
